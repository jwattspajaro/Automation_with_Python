### Managing Resource Relationships

When we declare a resource type, how do we differentiate between the original resource type and the name of a resource relationship being referenced in another resource?


⚪ Use "==" in place of "=>".


⚪ Assign it a variable name.


⚪ Use $ before the resource type.


⚫ Use lowercase for the original, and capitalize the resource name when referencing a relationship.

✅ **Correcto**
Nice job! When declaring resources initially, we type the resource type in lowercase. When we reference a resource relationship from another file, we capitalize the resource name being referenced.
