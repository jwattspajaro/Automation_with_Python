### Puppet Nodes
Pregunta

#### In Puppet, what can we use to categorize in order to apply different rules to different systems?



⚫  **Node definitions**


⚪ Manifest file


⚪ Array configuration


⚪ Template

✅ Correcto
Nice job! Different kinds of nodes are defined, allowing different sets of rule catalogs to apply to different types of machines.

### Puppet's Certificate Infrastructure
Pregunta

#### What is the purpose of the Certificate Authority (CA)?


⚪ To test rules in the manifest


⚪ To manage templates


⚫ To validate the identity of each machine	


⚪ To handle push/pull requests

✅ Correcto
### Awesome! The CA either queues a certificate request for manual validation, or uses pre-shared data to verify before sending the certificate to the agent.
