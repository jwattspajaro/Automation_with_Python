Pregunta

#### In Puppet, what can we use to categorize in order to apply different rules to different systems?



⚪  Node definitions


⚪ Manifest file


⚪ Array configuration


⚪ Template

✅ Correcto
Nice job! Different kinds of nodes are defined, allowing different sets of rule catalogs to apply to different types of machines.
