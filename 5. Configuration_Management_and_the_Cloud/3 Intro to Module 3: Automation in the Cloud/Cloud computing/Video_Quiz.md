### If a bare-bones cloud computing experience is needed as well as a high level of control over the software being run, what Cloud service would one choose?


⚪ Software as a Service


⚪ SQL cloud services


⚪ Platform as a Service


⚫ **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

✅Correcto
Great job! Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides users with the bare minimum needed to utilize a server’s computational resources, such as a virtual machine. It is the user's responsibility to configure everything else.
