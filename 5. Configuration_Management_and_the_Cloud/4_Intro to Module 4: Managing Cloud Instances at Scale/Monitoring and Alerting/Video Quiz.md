### Getting Alerts When Things Go Wrong
#### What do we call an alert that requires immediate attention?

⚪ Cron job


⚪ Bug report

      Nice job! Pages are alerts that need immediate human attention, and are often in the form of SMS or email.

### Service-Level Objectives
#### If our service has a Service Level Objective (SLO) of four-nines, what is our error budget measured in downtime percentage?


⚪ .001%


⚪ 1%


⚪ .1%


⚫ **.01%**

             ✅Correcto
            Nice job! If we have an SLO of 99.99%, that gives us an error budget of .01%.

 ### Basic Monitoring in GCP
 #### What type of policy requires us to set up a condition which notifies us when it’s triggered?


⚪ Login Policy


⚫ **Alerting Policy**


⚪ Security Policy


⚪ Bug Reporting Policy

            ✅Correcto
            Great work! An Alerting Policy specifies the conditions that trigger alerts, and the actions to be taken when these alerts are triggered, like sending an email address notification.
