#### Video: Manual Testing and Automated Testing

The advantage of running automated tests is that they will always get the same expected ___ if the software code is good.

⚪ Command line arguments

⚪ Parameters

⚫ **Results**

⚪ Interpreters
Automatic tests will always get the same expected result if the software code is good.

# Unit Tests



#### Video: Unit Tests

An important characteristic of a unit test is ___. 

⚫ **Isolation.**

⚪ A production environment

⚪ An external database

⚪ Automation.

Unit tests test the piece of code they target.

⚫ **unittest**

⚪ assertEqual

⚪ Test

> This module provides a TestCase class with a bunch of testing methods.

#### Video: Edge Cases

Which of the following would NOT be considered as an edge case when testing a software's input for a user's first and last name?

⚪ -100

⚫ **Jeffrey**

⚪ Ben05

⚪ 0

#### Video: Additional Test Cases

Which of the following is NOT an advantage of running an automatic unit test in a suite for a single function?

⚪ Efficiency

⚫ **Creating multiple test scripts**

⚪ Creating one script for multiple test cases

⚪ Reusable test cases

It’s harder to manage multiple test scripts.



## Other Test Concepts

### Video: Black Box vs. White Box

Which of the following is descriptive of a black-box test case?

⚪ The tester is familiar with the code.

⚪ The code is open-source.

⚫ **Code is opaque.**

⚪ Tests are created alongside the code development.

> Black-box tests have no knowledge of the code.

---

#### Video: Other Test Types

Running a piece of software code as-is to see if it runs describes what type of testing?

⚪ Load test

⚫ **Smoke test**

⚪ Integration test

⚪ Regression test

Keep it up! This test finds out if the program can run in its basic form before undergoing more refined test cases.

#### Errors and Exceptions



### Video: The Try-Except Construct

When a try block is not able to execute a function, which of the following return examples will an exception block most likely NOT return?

⚪ Empty String

⚪ Zero

⚫ **Error**

⚪ Empty List

An exception is not meant to produce an error, but to bypass it. 

---

#### Video: Raising Errors

What keyword can help provide a reason an error has occurred in a function?

⚪ return

⚫ **assert**

⚪ raise

⚪ minlen

This keyword is used to produce a message when a conditional is false.

----

#### Video: Testing for Expected Errors

When using the assertRaises method, what is passed first?

 ⚫ **Error**

⚪ Function name

⚪ Parameters

⚪ Conditional

Way to go! The expected error is passed first.
