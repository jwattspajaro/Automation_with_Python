Why does this code raise an error:

1 print("1234"+5678)


☑️  Because Python doesn't know how to add a number to a string.


⬜ Because in Python it's only possible to add numbers, not strings.


⬜ Because in Python it's not possible to print integers.


⬜ Because numbers shouldn't be written between quotes.

 ✅ Correcto
Right on! Python can add a number to a number or a string to a string, but it doesn't know how to add a number to a string.
