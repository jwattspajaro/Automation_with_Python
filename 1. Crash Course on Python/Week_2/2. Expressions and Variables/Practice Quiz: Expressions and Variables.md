In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

``` PYTHON
bill = 57.28
tip = bill *1.30
total = (bill + tip)/2
share = total/2
print(("Each person needs to pay: ")+ str(share))
```

Each person needs to pay: 32.936
