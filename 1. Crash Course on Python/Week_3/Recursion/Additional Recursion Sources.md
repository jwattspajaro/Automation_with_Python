In the past videos, we visited the basic concepts of recursive functions.

A recursive function must include a recursive case and base case. The recursive case calls the function again, with a different value. The base case returns a value without calling the same function.

A recursive function will usually have this structure:
``` PYTHON
def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition(parameters):
        return base_case_value
    recursive_function(modified_parameters)
```
